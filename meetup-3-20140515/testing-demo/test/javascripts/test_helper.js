// Teaspoon includes some support files, but you can use anything from your own support path too.
// require support/sinon
// require support/your-support-file
//
// PhantomJS (Teaspoons default driver) doesn't have support for Function.prototype.bind, which has caused confusion.
// Use this polyfill to avoid the confusion.
//= require support/bind-poly
//
// Deferring execution
// If you're using CommonJS, RequireJS or some other asynchronous library you can defer execution. Call
// Teaspoon.execute() after everything has been loaded. Simple example of a timeout:
//
// Teaspoon.defer = true
// setTimeout(Teaspoon.execute, 1000)
//
// Matching files
// By default Teaspoon will look for files that match _test.{js,js.coffee,.coffee}. Add a filename_test.js file in your
// test path and it'll be included in the default suite automatically. If you want to customize suites, check out the
// configuration in config/initializers/teaspoon.rb
//
// Manifest
// If you'd rather require your test files manually (to control order for instance) you can disable the suite matcher in
// the configuration and use this file as a manifest.
//
// For more information: http://github.com/modeset/teaspoon
//
// You can require your own javascript files here. By default this will include everything in application, however you
// may get better load performance if you require the specific files that are being used in the test that tests them.
//= require application
//= require_tree ./lib
//= require_tree ./integration
